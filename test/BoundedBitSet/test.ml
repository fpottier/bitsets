(* This test is not super-interesting, as the implementation of BoundedBitSet
   is almost trivial; it simply selects an appropriate implementation, based
   on the value of [n]. *)

(* Plus, at the moment, only one (random) choice of [n] is made at the start,
   then the test runs forever with this value of [n]. This could be remedied
   by choosing [n] inside Monolith's prologue -- as done in Sek -- but I am
   lazy. *)
