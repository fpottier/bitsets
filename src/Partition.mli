(**This module implements a [partition] function, which, given a list [xs] of
   possibly-overlapping sets, computes the coarsest partition of the the set
   [U xs] that refines [xs]. In other words, it computes the coarsest family
   [ys] of non-overlapping sets such that each set in the list [xs] can be
   written as a disjoint union of members of [ys].

   This is useful when representing the transitions of a DFA whose alphabet is
   large. Rather than representing one transition per symbol, we group the
   symbols into classes whose elements are never distinguished. *)
