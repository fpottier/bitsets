(**This module offers bitsets whose elements are not subject to a bound.
   These bit sets can store arbitrary nonnegative integer values. Their
   internal representation is sparse: a bit set is represented as a linked
   list of words. *)

(**The type [view] offers a view of a set as a list of words.

   The constructor [N] represents the empty set.

   The constructor [C (o, word, s)] represents the disjoint union of
   the set [word], whose inhabitants must be shifted up by [o], and
   the set [s].

   The offset [o] is always a multiple of
   [WordBitSet.bound]. *)
