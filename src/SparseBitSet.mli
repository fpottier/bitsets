(**This module offers immutable bit sets whose elements are not subject to
   a bound. These bit sets can store arbitrary nonnegative integer values.
   Their internal representation is sparse: a bit set is represented as a
   linked list of words. *)

(* The type [view] and the function [view] are currently not part of
   the signature [API.SET]. They are not publicly documented. *)

(**The type [view] offers a view of a set as a list of nonempty words.

   The constructor [N] represents the empty set.

   The constructor [C (o, w, s)] represents the disjoint union of the
   nonempty set [w], whose inhabitants must be shifted up by [o],
   and the set [s].

   An offset [o] is a nonnegative multiple of [WordBitSet.bound]. *)
